            <h1>Dear Martina,</h1>
              <p>Since the day I met you, I began to love. Not just the romantic or casual kind; a resonance in my soul. Something inside of me sparked and I’ve felt a warmth I’ve never felt before. The heat embraces me, scorches my impurities, and soothes my scars. A love so rushing, yet so calm it’s sublime to feel. A feeling that is so vast, complex, and potent that none of the words of this world could come near to describing, except for maybe a couple. True Love.</p>

              <p>Ever since I was a kid, I’ve always wanted to do romantic things with a woman. Hold hands during PE, share a water bottle, maybe stomp on each other's feet under the desk haha. These simple interactions are fantasies I’ve always romanticized, but I was no prince charming. You know my backstory, I won’t go into detail, but we both know it wasn’t the brightest. Pretty dim for many years, even during my college years.</p>

              <p>But then came a shine, no — a streak of light peering through my dim enclosure of a life.</p>

              <p>This light wasn’t as radiant as the sun rays, or colorful like the rainbow, but rather this one was Peaceful.</p>

              <p>In my many years of accumulating stresses and responsibilities, this glimmer eased the weight off my shoulders, they slid down and splashed into the pool of myself.</p>

              <p>There it was, I saw the same white gentle light, atop the ripples of me. A reflection, an echo, a friend?</p>

              <p>No, I knew it was something deeper than that, but at the moment I chose to be wary of this light, unbeknownst to its attributes and such, I kept my distance, but also my curiosity.</p>

              <p>After my first interaction with the silver lining, I was intrigued! My mind wandered throughout the days dreaming of this ethereal luminescence.</p>

              <p>Who is she? What does she like to do? Does she like chocolate? I mean I like chocolate. But seriously though why do I want her to like what I like? Hm. I guess I want to get closer to her, I want to understand who she was under those ribbons of white shine.</p>

              <p>As time went on and on, I noticed something off… My heart felt more clear, and visible. Almost as if it’s been Illuminated.</p>

              <p>The tranquil gleam has entered through the cracks of my heart, reaching in such sensitive spots, my mind and body became flustered.</p>

              <p>Passion!</p>

              <p>I began to grow an unwavering want to let the light flood my heart, as I wanted to reciprocate the same. I wanted to fulfill a soulful connection between the two of us; to bridge two sides of the same coin, or forge a path between two celestials. Like the Sun and the Moon.</p>

              <p>That’s when it struck me. This light that has been massaging the strains of my mind, easing my matter, and bringing tranquility to a troubled man.</p>

              <p>The light is that of the Moon. A light that emanates from a milky orb, tens of thousands of miles away from our home, yet bringing light to those lost in the dark. We know it’s gentle, but its tenacity tears the oceans into waves.</p>

              <p>Wait… It doesn’t emanate, no. The moon doesn’t produce or procure this shine. It’s a reflection. A reflection of the sun. A reflection of blazed brilliance that scorches in the summer and kills in the winter. Rays so ravish, its heat knows no bounds.</p>

              <p>Yet, this moon, takes the full front of the heat, anguish, and flame, and returns it as solemnity.</p>

              <p>She wasn’t a producer of such gentleness, no. She was a being capable of taking the heat of all that which burns, and reflects back a gentle silver smile.</p>

              <p>My moon, oh my Moon.</p>

              <p>God, how blessed I am to bathe in the sweetness of your creation, its beams penetrating my soul, illuminating my very self to a higher means.</p>

              <p>My Tina, oh how much I love all that you’ve done for me, and how much more I want to do for you. You are the accumulation of everyone’s full bluntness of themselves, reflected as a tranquil radiance, quietly soothing all my afflictions as well as your loveliest peers.</p>

              <p>I love how we call, text, and think about our affection for one another. I am truly truly blessed to be with you, not someone like you, I am blessed with you.</p>

              <p>I love our silly conversations, or our deep talks. When I’m with you, I truly feel safe and open to yap till I dehydrate. You give me that safe space &lt;3.</p>

              <p>Oh and your beauty? How do I even begin? A face round and bright like the moon, hair silky like the strands of the milky way, eyes glimmering with bits of stars, and a smile that shines brighter than the sun. A soothing tone like the whistle between mountains and kindness sweeter than ambrosia.</p>

              <p>When you walked into my life, the skies of my mind lit with northern lights, revealing parts of me I thought were buried, but now free to be loved.</p>

              <p>This was a short story of how I saw you in our earlier times, and today your silver highlights continue to paint my life prettier than ever before.</p>

              <p>I love you,</p>

              <p>my sweet moon</p>

              <p>- Ryan</p>
